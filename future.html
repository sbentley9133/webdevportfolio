    <h2>Career</h2>
      I'm still not 100 percent sure what I want to do for the next 50 years of my life. I know I like coding and I could see myself doing it for a long time but I have so many goals and dreams of what I want to do. This seems like a really good start. I could see myself following the tech career path and doing this. In my wildest dreams, someday I really get crazy into coding and work for Google, or even create my own huge search engine that really takes off. For now I think I would like to build websites for local businesses and build a client list. Eventually I may work up a big enough base that I can continue freelancing and hopefully become able to support myself more. After this certificate program I think I might use the transfer credits and finish my degree at Dixie State. 
    <h2>Personally</h2>
    <p>I am hugely family-oriented and I want to invest more time into my family. I want to one day be able to support my dad and buy him his own house. I want to get him all the Oakland Raiders(soon to be Vegas, he's not happy about it) season tickets money can buy.I want to buy my own house in cash and stop paying rent every month; even just since August I am exhausted of being an adult. My main goal for adulthood is just to not be worried about my bank account and to be able to help my family with whatever they need. </p>
