    <h2>What do I do?</h2>
    <p>In my two minutes of free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and doing things with them. The go-to for a free Saturday night is to go see whatever new movie is playing at our local theater. We also drive around town listening to music or we go to Walmart and walk around. If you come from a small town you get this. There isn't much near me that is fun and cheap enough for a broke college student. Outside of being with friends, I like playing some video games. I am also pretty heavily into art, like drawing and painting. I spend most of my time rewatching The Office on Netflix and taking care of my dog.</p>

    <h2>I don't know if these count as hobbies buttt</h2>
    <p>In high school I was very involved the drama club. I worked backstage for every production over the last two years of my high school career. I designed and built sets and backdrops, I also did a lot of the special effects makeup for the actors and actresses. If my city had a local production company I would likely be doing a lot of that. Since graduation I have channeled my art into painting furniture around my house and customizing clothes for my friends and I. </p>
