    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is Samantha Bentley, call me Sam. I am an 18 year old from Evanston, Wyoming. I graduated high school in June, 2019. I am the only girl out of 5 kids, which to say the least, has been a <em>weird</em> experience. I grew up in a very small town and I've had the same friends since middle school. I am currently working and living in a house with some friends and my dog Pennywise.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How I Got This Far</h2>
    <p> I initially got into coding when I was a sophomore in high school. I went lived in Saint George, Utah with my mom and I went to an early college high school called SUCCESS Academy, where I took classes through Dixie State University. I learned all of the basics of coding and styling websites, as well as coding programs. After a year of being in that program I moved back to my hometown in Wyoming and I've been here since.</p>
